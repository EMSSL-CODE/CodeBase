# CodeBase
This is the code base for EMSSL: One place for all previously used sensor code, regardless of platform. 

Instructions:
1. Obtain a sensor and microcontroller.
2. Write code for calibration and operation as needed. 
3. Debug the code and make sure it works. 
4. Post this to Github so that everyone can use the code as needed. 
    1. Create a folder on your local repo with the name of your sensor.
    2. Add all code files for Arduino, Pi, etc. that are required and any other documentation (wiring diagram, pinout, etc.)
    3. Add files, commit (with a message!), and push to git
